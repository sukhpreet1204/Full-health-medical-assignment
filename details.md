Lab Results Parser
Implement a solution to read and parse a text file which represents some laboratory test results.

Requirements
Implement the Parser class
Unit tests using Rspec or Test::Unit
Upload the code to a git repository. It can be private, just give access to rodrigo.aquino@fullhealthmedical.com
Lab results file
Here is an example of the lab results file to be parsed.

OBX|1|C100|20.0|
NTE|1|Comment for C100 result|
OBX|2|C200|500|
NTE|2|Comment for C200 result|
OBX|3|A250|NEGATIVE|
NTE|3|Comment for NEGATIVE result|
OBX|4|B250|++|
NTE|4|Comment 1 for ++ result|
NTE|4|Comment 2 for ++ result|
File Format
A laboratory results file may contain one or more test results. Each laboratory result is reported in 2 or more lines:

The first line of each test result starts with the string OBX followed by an integer which represents the index for the laboratory result.
The following lines contain the comments for the test result. Each comment line starts with the string NTE and has the same index of its laboratory result.
Laboratory result codes
These are the test codes with the format they're reported.

Code	format
C100	float
C200	float
A250	boolean
B250	nil_3plus
Laboratory result format
As explained above, each laboratory result is reported in a specific format.

The table below maps how each input from the laboratory results file should be mapped to the class LaboratoryTestResult:

Format	input value	Mapped value
float	'20'	20.0
boolean	'NEGATIVE'	-1.0
boolean	'POSITIVE'	-2.0
nil_3plus	'NIL'	-1.0
nil_3plus	'+'	-2.0
nil_3plus	'++'	-2.0
nil_3plus	'+++'	-3.0
Implementation
This section explaing the 2 required classes to use on this solution.

LaboratoryTestResult
For the purpose of this test a plain Ruby class can be used. The fields are commented below.

class LaboratoryTestResult 
  # columns 
  #   :code :string
  #   :result :float
  #   :format :string
  #   :comment :strint
end
Parser
The parser receives the file path of the laboratory test results file and returns an responds to the method mapped_results which returns an array of LaboratoryTestResult

class Parser
  def initialize(file_path)
    # ...
  end
  
  def mapped_results
    # ...
  end
end

file_path = "/tmp/result1.txt"
parser = Parser.new(file_path)
parser.mapped_results # => [...]
Examples and expected result
/lab1.txt

OBX|1|C100|20.0|
NTE|1|Comment for C100 result|
parser = Parser.new('/lab1.txt')
parser.mapped_results # => [
 LaboratoryTestResult.new(code: 'C100', result: 20.0, format: 'float', comment: 'Comment for C100 result')
]
/lab2.txt

OBX|1|A250|NEGATIVE|
NTE|1|Comment for NEGATIVE result|
OBX|2|B250|++|
NTE|2|Comment 1 for ++ result|
NTE|2|Comment 2 for ++ result|
parser = Parser.new('/lab2.txt')
parser.mapped_results # => [
 LaboratoryTestResult.new(code: 'A250', result: -1.0, format: 'boolean', comment: 'Comment for NEGATIVE result'),
 LaboratoryTestResult.new(code: 'B250', result: -2.0, format: 'nil_3plus', comment: "Comment 1 for ++ result\nComment 1 for ++ result")
]
